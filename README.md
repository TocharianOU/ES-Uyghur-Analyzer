# Elasticsearch Uyghur Analyzer Plugin

## Project Introduction
The **Elasticsearch Uyghur Analyzer Plugin** provides robust support for analyzing and processing Uyghur text within Elasticsearch, featuring two specialized analyzers and token filters designed specifically for Uyghur language needs. This plugin is ideal for natural language processing (NLP) applications requiring accurate tokenization and morphological analysis for Uyghur.

## Features for Uyghur Text Processing
- **Two Tokenization Methods**: This plugin includes two custom tokenizers for Uyghur language processing, designed to handle unique linguistic properties of Uyghur text:
  1. **uyghur_original_tokenizer**: Restores morphological features by reversing vowel weakening, bringing semantic units back to their original form.
  2. **uyghur_split_tokenizer**: Directly segments text while retaining weakened vowels, ensuring accurate representation in tokenized text.

- **Stemming and Linguistic Analysis**: Includes stemming and other linguistic feature analyses optimized for Uyghur, improving accuracy in text processing and language analysis.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the analyzers and token filters to fit specific Uyghur text processing needs within Elasticsearch.

## Quick Start Guide
To quickly get started with the **Uyghur Analyzer Plugin**:

1. **Install the Plugin**: Begin with the setup instructions found in the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md).
2. **Configure the Tokenizers**:
   - Add `uyghur_original_tokenizer` for morphology-restoring tokenization.
   - Use `uyghur_split_tokenizer` for direct segmentation with vowel weakening preserved.
3. **Run Example Queries**: Test the plugin with sample queries to verify tokenization accuracy and filtering.

For further setup details, visit the full [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md).
